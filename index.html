                    <h2>Track Events</h2>
                    <p>Track and field events are typically divided into running, hurdling, and relay races. The most common race distances are the 100 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters, 800 meters, and the long-distance events like the 1500 meters and 5000 meters. Runners compete against each other on a standardized track, with lanes clearly marked for each competitor.</p>
                    <p>The 100m dash is one of the most exciting events in track and field, where athletes showcase their speed and power in a race that lasts only a few seconds. The 400m race is also known for testing an athlete's endurance, as it combines speed and stamina, requiring runners to pace themselves while sprinting around the track.</p>
                    <p>Relay races involve teams of four athletes, each running a portion of the total race distance. The baton must be passed from one runner to the next in a seamless manner, requiring teamwork, coordination, and speed.</p>

                    <h2>Field Events</h2>
                    <p>Field events in track and field include disciplines such as long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, and javelin. Athletes participating in field events focus on strength, technique, and agility. The long jump, for instance, involves sprinting down a runway and leaping as far as possible into a sandpit, while the high jump requires athletes to clear a bar set at increasing heights using a combination of technique and physical ability.</p>
                    <p>The pole vault is another highly technical field event in which athletes use a pole to propel themselves over a high bar. This event combines both strength and flexibility, requiring athletes to time their jumps perfectly and use the pole to achieve maximum height.</p>
                    <p>In the throwing events, athletes compete to throw the shot put, discus, or javelin as far as possible. These events test an athlete's explosive strength and technique. The javelin throw, for example, involves throwing a spear-like object as far as possible, requiring both power and precision.</p>
